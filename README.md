A Django Application , with Ethereum as Blockchain Networks which helps in eliminating Fake Medical Certificates.

Asking for a medical certificate is the most common practice among organizations when employees avail their medical leaves. 
However, some employees can use counterfeited health certificates; some may even get fake ones from the widely available online doctors. 
Therefore, it is difficult for organizations to distinguish between genuine and fake medical certificates. 
So, organizations need to find a fool-proof solution to identify fake medical certificates for making informed decisions. 
We have built a portal which allows you to get your certificate from the hospital whenever you want and also ensure there are no fake certificates out there.
A patient can apply for the certificate by filling an application form, 
the doctor can then accept his application upon which he/she can download his/her certificate with a unique number.
His vital information gets stored on our blockchain network and remains safe and secure.
